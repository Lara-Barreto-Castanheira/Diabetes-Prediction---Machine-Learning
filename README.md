# Diabetes Prediction - Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project centres on the development of a Logistic Regression model to predict the presence or absence of diabetes using various clinical and demographic variables. The project includes data pre-processing, model training and a comprehensive evaluation using metrics such as the confusion matrix and the ROC curve. However, before coming to the conclusion that a binary logistic regression would be used, other models were trialled to understand how they behaved and whether they were suitable for this data. 

## Libraries
The libraries needed for this project can be found in the ‘requirements.txt’ file

## Installation
To install the necessary packages in the terminal, you can use pip, which is Python's package manager. Here are the commands to install each package mentioned:

* pip install pandas
* pip install matplotlib
* pip install seaborn
* pip install numpy
* pip instal scikit-learn

Once you have installed these packages, you can use them in your Python code without any problems. If you're already using a virtual environment (‘conda’), make sure it's activated before running the pip commands to install the packages in the correct environment.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Diabetes dataset from Kaggle and it includes the following features:

Age: Age of the patient.
Gender: Gender of the patient.
BMI: Body Mass Index.
Blood Pressure: Blood pressure measurement.
Glucose Level: Plasma glucose concentration.
Insulin Level: Serum insulin level.
Hypertension: High blood pressure increasing heart disease risk.
Heart Disease: Conditions affecting the heart.
Smoking history: Past tobacco use heightening risk of hypertension and heart disease.
Diabetes Outcome: Target variable indicating diabetes presence (1) or absence (0).
