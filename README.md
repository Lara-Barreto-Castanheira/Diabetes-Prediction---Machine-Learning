# Diabetes Prediction - Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a Logistic Regression model to predict the presence or absence of diabetes using various clinical and demographic variables. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and comprehensive evaluation using metrics like the confusion matrix and ROC curve.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Diabetes dataset and includes the following features:

Age: Age of the patient.
Gender: Gender of the patient.
BMI: Body Mass Index.
Blood Pressure: Blood pressure measurement.
Glucose Level: Plasma glucose concentration.
Insulin Level: Serum insulin level.
Hypertension: High blood pressure increasing heart disease risk.
Heart Disease: Conditions affecting the heart.
Smoking history: Past tobacco use heightening risk of hypertension and heart disease.
Diabetes Outcome: Target variable indicating diabetes presence (1) or absence (0).
